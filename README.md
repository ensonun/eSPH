# eSPH
eSPH is a simple, lightweight 2D Riemann solver based SPH code written in MATLAB.

It is part of Enson's final year project at Imperial College London. For more information please refer to my thesis.

## Dependencies

The code uses the functions in this repository and MATLAB built-in functions only.

To enable parallel computing, please ensure that the [Parallel Computing Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html) is installed.

The current version of the code is tested with MATLAB 2019a.

## I/O
The main code ```mainSPH.m``` takes in an input file named ```input.mat``` which contains the following variables:
